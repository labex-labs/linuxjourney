## Lesson Content

Before our machine actually hits DNS to do a query, it first looks locally on our machines.

### /etc/hosts

The `/etc/hosts` file contains mappings of some hostnames to IP addresses. The fields are pretty self-explanatory: there is one for the IP address, the hostname, and then any aliases for the host.

```plaintext
pete@icebox:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       icebox
```

You'll typically see your localhost address listed as a default in this file. You can also manage access to hosts by modifying the `/etc/hosts.deny` or `/etc/hosts.allow` files. However, if you were security-conscious, this isn't really the way to go, and you should be modifying your firewall rules instead.

Let's see a fun example of `/etc/hosts`. Modify the file and add a line for:

```plaintext
123.45.6.7  www.google.com
```

Save the file and now go to <www.google.com>. Having issues, aren't you? Well, that's because we just mapped <www.google.com> to a completely wrong IP address. Since our hosts first look locally for IP address mappings, it never reaches DNS to find google.com.

### /etc/resolv.conf

Traditionally, we've used a file called `/etc/resolv.conf` to map DNS name servers for more efficient lookups. However, with the improvements made to DNS, this file is quite often irrelevant. In fact, you can see in my example below that `/etc/resolv.conf` isn't managed manually. Refer to your distribution-specific settings to manage DNS name server mappings.

```plaintext
conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
nameserver 127.0.1.1
search localdomain
```
