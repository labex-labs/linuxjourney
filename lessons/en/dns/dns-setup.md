## Lesson Content

We won't go through setting up a DNS server, as that would be quite a lengthy tutorial. Instead, here is a quick comparison list of popular DNS servers to use with Linux.

### BIND

The most popular DNS server on the Internet, it's the standard that is used with Linux distributions. It was originally developed at the University of California at Berkeley, hence the name BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain). If you need full-featured power and flexibility, you can't go wrong with BIND.

### DNSmasq

Lightweight and much easier to configure than BIND. If you want simplicity and don't need all the bells and whistles of BIND, use DNSmasq. It comes with all the tools you need to set up DHCP and DNS, recommended for a smaller network.

### PowerDNS

Full-featured and similar to BIND, it offers you a little bit more flexibility with options. It reads information from multiple databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., for easier administration. Just because BIND has been the way we do things, it doesn't mean it has to stay that way.

This isn't a complete list, but it should give you an idea of where to look if you are setting up your own DNS server.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of DNS in Linux:

1. **[Query DNS Records in Linux with dig and nslookup](https://labex.io/labs/linux-query-dns-records-in-linux-with-dig-and-nslookup)** - Learn to use essential command-line tools like `dig` and `nslookup` to query various DNS record types and troubleshoot DNS resolution issues.
2. **[Set Up a Local Authoritative DNS Server on Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-set-up-a-local-authoritative-dns-server-on-linux)** - Gain practical experience by installing and configuring `bind9` to set up your own local authoritative DNS server, defining zones, and testing resolution.

These labs will help you apply the concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with DNS management in Linux.
