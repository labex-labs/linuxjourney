## Lesson Content

Changing permissions can easily be done with the `chmod` command.

First, pick which permission set you want to change: user, group, or other. You can add or remove permissions with a `+` or `-`. Let's look at some examples.

### Adding permission bit on a file

```bash
chmod u+x myfile
```

The above command reads like this: change permission on `myfile` by adding the executable permission bit to the user set. So now the user has executable permission on this file!

### Removing permission bit on a file

```bash
chmod u-x myfile
```

### Adding multiple permission bits on a file

```bash
chmod ug+w
```

There is another way to change permissions using numerical format. This method allows you to change permissions all at once. Instead of using r, w, or x to represent permissions, you'll use a numerical representation for a single permission set. So there's no need to specify the group with `g` or the user with `u`.

The numerical representations are seen below:

- 4: read permission
- 2: write permission
- 1: execute permission

Let's look at an example:

```bash
chmod 755 myfile
```

Can you guess what permissions we are giving this file? Let's break this down: `755` covers the permissions for all sets. The first number (7) represents user permissions, the second number (5) represents group permissions, and the last 5 represents other permissions.

Wait a minute, 7 and 5 weren't listed above. Where are we getting these numbers? Remember, we are combining all the permissions into one number now, so you'll have to get some math involved.

7 = 4 + 2 + 1, so 7 is the user permissions, and it has read, write, and execute permissions.

5 = 4 + 1, the group has read and execute permissions.

5 = 4 + 1, and all other users have read and execute permissions.

One thing to note: it's not a great idea to be changing permissions willy-nilly. You could potentially expose a sensitive file for everyone to modify. However, many times you legitimately want to change permissions; just take precaution when using the `chmod` command.

## Exercise

Change some basic text file permissions and see the bits changing as you do an `ls -l`.
