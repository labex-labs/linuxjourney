## Lesson Content

In addition to modifying permissions on files, you can also modify the group and user ownership of the file.

### Modify user ownership

```bash
sudo chown patty myfile
```

This command will set the owner of `myfile` to `patty`.

### Modify group ownership

```bash
sudo chgrp whales myfile
```

This command will set the group of `myfile` to `whales`.

### Modify both user and group ownership at the same time

If you add a colon and group name after the user, you can set both the user and group at the same time.

```bash
sudo chown patty:whales myfile
```

## Exercise

Modify the group and user of some test files. Afterward, take a look at the permissions with `ls -l`.
