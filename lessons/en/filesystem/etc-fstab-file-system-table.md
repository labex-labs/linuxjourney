## Lesson Content

When we want to automatically mount filesystems at startup, we can add them to a file called `/etc/fstab` (pronounced "eff es tab," not "eff stab"), short for filesystem table. This file contains a permanent list of filesystems that are mounted.

```plaintext
pete@icebox:~$ cat /etc/fstab
UUID=130b882f-7d79-436d-a096-1e594c92bb76 /               ext4    relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1
UUID=78d203a0-7c18-49bd-9e07-54f44cdb5726 /home           xfs     relatime        0       2
UUID=22c3d34b-467e-467c-b44d-f03803c2c526 none            swap    sw              0       0
```

Each line represents one filesystem; the fields are:

- UUID - Device identifier
- Mount point - Directory the filesystem is mounted to
- Filesystem type
- Options - Other mount options; see manpage for more details
- Dump - Used by the dump utility to decide when to make a backup; you should just default to 0
- Pass - Used by fsck to decide what order filesystems should be checked; if the value is 0, it will not be checked

To add an entry, just directly modify the `/etc/fstab` file using the entry syntax above. Be careful when modifying this file; you could potentially make your life a little harder if you mess up.

## Exercise

Add the USB drive we've been working on as an entry in `/etc/fstab`. When you reboot, you should still see it mounted.
