## Lesson Content

The `traceroute` command is used to see how packets are routed. It works by sending packets with increasing TTL (Time To Live) values, starting with 1. So, the first router receives the packet and decrements the TTL value by one, thus dropping the packet. The router sends back an ICMP Time Exceeded message to us. Then, the next packet gets a TTL of 2, so it makes it past the first router, but when it gets to the second router, the TTL is 0, and it returns another ICMP Time Exceeded message. Traceroute works this way because as it sends and drops packets, it builds a list of routers that the packets traverse until it finally gets to its destination and receives an ICMP Echo Reply message.

Here's a little snippet of a traceroute:

```bash
$ traceroute google.com
traceroute to google.com (216.58.216.174), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  192.168.4.254 (192.168.4.254)  0.028 ms  0.009 ms  0.008 ms
 2  100.64.1.113 (100.64.1.113)  1.227 ms  1.226 ms 0.920 ms
 3  100.64.0.20 (100.64.0.20)  1.501 ms 1.556 ms  0.855 ms
```

Each line represents a router or machine that is between you and your target. It shows the name of the target and its IP address, and the last three columns correspond to the round-trip time of a packet to reach that router. By default, three packets are sent along the route.

## Exercise
