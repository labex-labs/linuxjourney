## Lesson Content

When you run multiple things on your computer, like perhaps Chrome, Microsoft Word, or Photoshop at the same time, it may seem like these processes are running simultaneously, but that isn't quite true.

Processes use the CPU for a small amount of time called a time slice. Then they pause for milliseconds, and another process gets a little time slice. By default, process scheduling happens in this round-robin fashion. Every process gets enough time slices until it's finished processing. The kernel handles all of these process switches, and it does a pretty good job most of the time.

Processes aren't able to decide when and how long they get CPU time. If all processes behaved normally, they would each (roughly) get an equal amount of CPU time. However, there is a way to influence the kernel's process scheduling algorithm with a nice value. Niceness is a pretty weird name, but what it means is that processes have a number to determine their priority for the CPU. A high number means the process is "nice" and has a lower priority for the CPU, and a low or negative number means the process is not very "nice" and it wants to get as much of the CPU as possible.

```bash
top
```

You can see a column for `NI` right now; that is the niceness level of a process.

To change the niceness level, you can use the `nice` and `renice` commands:

```bash
nice -n 5 apt upgrade
```

The `nice` command is used to set priority for a new process. The `renice` command is used to set priority on an existing process.

```bash
renice 10 -p 3245
```

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of Linux process management and scheduling:

1. **[Manage and Monitor Linux Processes](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-and-monitor-linux-processes-590864)** - Practice interacting with foreground and background processes, inspecting them with `ps`, monitoring resources with `top`, adjusting priority with `renice`, and terminating them with `kill`.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of process scheduling and niceness in real scenarios and build confidence with managing processes in Linux.

## Quiz Question
