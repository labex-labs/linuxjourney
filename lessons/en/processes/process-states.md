## Lesson Content

Let's take a look at the `ps aux` command again:

```bash
ps aux
```

In the STAT column, you'll see many values. A Linux process can be in a number of different states. The most common state codes you'll see are described below:

- **R**: Running or runnable; it is just waiting for the CPU to process it.
- **S**: Interruptible sleep; waiting for an event to complete, such as input from the terminal.
- **D**: Uninterruptible sleep; processes that cannot be killed or interrupted with a signal. Usually, to make them go away, you have to reboot or fix the issue.
- **Z**: Zombie; we discussed in a previous lesson that zombies are terminated processes that are waiting to have their statuses collected.
- **T**: Stopped; a process that has been suspended/stopped.

## Exercise

Take a look at the running processes on your system and check out their process states.
