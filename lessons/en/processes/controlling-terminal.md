## Lesson Content

We discussed how there is a TTY field in the `ps` output. The TTY is the terminal that executed the command.

There are two types of terminals: regular **terminal devices** and **pseudoterminal devices**. A regular terminal device is a native terminal device that you can type into and send output to your system. This sounds like the terminal application you've been launching to get to your shell, but it's not.

We're going to segue so you can see this in action. Go ahead and type Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get into TTY1 (the first virtual console). You'll notice how you don't have anything except the terminalâ€”no graphics, etc. This is considered a regular terminal device. You can exit this with Ctrl-Alt-F7.

A pseudoterminal is what you've been used to working in. They emulate terminals with the shell terminal window and are denoted by PTS. If you look at `ps` again, you'll see your shell process under `pts/*`.

Okay, now circling back to the controlling terminal: processes are usually bound to a controlling terminal. For example, if you were running a program in your shell window, such as `find`, and you closed the window, your process would also terminate with it.

There are processes such as daemon processes, which are special processes that are essentially keeping the system running. They often start at system boot and usually get terminated when the system is shut down. They run in the background, and since we don't want these special processes to get terminated, they are not bound to a controlling terminal. In the `ps` output, the TTY is listed as a **?**, meaning it does not have a controlling terminal.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here is a hands-on lab to reinforce your understanding of Linux processes and their interaction with terminals:

1. **[Manage and Monitor Linux Processes](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-and-monitor-linux-processes-590864)** - In this lab, you will learn essential skills for managing and monitoring processes on a Linux system. You will explore how to interact with foreground and background processes, inspect them with `ps`, monitor resources with `top`, adjust priority with `renice`, and terminate them with `kill`.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of process management in real scenarios and build confidence with understanding how processes run and interact with the system.
