## Lesson Content

To search for an expression, just type the `/` key and then your search term while you are in a Vim session. Once you hit Enter, you can press `n` to go forward or `N` to go backward in your search results.

```plaintext
My pretty file is very pretty.

/pretty

will find the pretty words in the text file.
```

The `?` search command will search the text file backward. So, in the previous example, the last "pretty" would come up first.

```plaintext
My pretty file is very pretty.

?pretty

will find the pretty words in the text file.
```
