## Lesson Content

Vim has two main modes you will use often: Normal mode (for commands) and Insert mode (for typing text).

- Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode at any time.

Enter Insert mode in different ways depending on where you want to type:

- `i` – insert before the cursor
- `a` – append after the cursor
- `I` – insert at the beginning of the current line
- `A` – append at the end of the current line
- `o` – open a new line below the current line and start inserting
- `O` – open a new line above the current line and start inserting

Tip: You can prefix these with a count. For example, `3o` opens three new lines below.

When you are done inserting text, press `Esc` to go back to Normal mode.

## Exercise

Open any text file with `vim [file]` and try: `i`, `a`, `I`, `A`, `o`, `O`, then press `Esc` after each to return to Normal mode.
