# Emacs Exiting and Help

## Lesson Content

**To close out of Emacs**

```
C-x C-c

If you have any open buffers, it will ask you to save before closing out of Emacs.

**Confused?**

```
C-h C-h : help menu
```

**Undo**

```
C-x u
```

As you can see, Emacs has more moving parts, so the learning curve is a little steeper. In exchange, though, you get a very powerful text editor.
