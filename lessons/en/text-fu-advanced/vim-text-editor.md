## Lesson Content

Vim stands for Vi Improved. Just like its name suggests, it is an improved version of the Vi text editor.

It's super lightweight; opening and editing a file with Vim is quick and easy. It's also almost always available. If you boot up a random Linux distribution, chances are Vim is installed by default.

To fire up Vim, just type:

```bash
vim
```
