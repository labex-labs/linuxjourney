## Lesson Content

Now you may notice, the mouse is nowhere in use here. To navigate a text document in Vim, use the following keys:

- `h` or the left arrow - will move you left one character
- `j` or the up arrow - will move you up one line
- `k` or the down arrow - will move you down one line
- `l` or the right arrow - will move you right one character

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of text editor navigation and usage:
