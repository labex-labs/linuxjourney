## Lesson Content

To move around buffers (or files you're visiting), use the following commands:

### Switch buffers

```
C-x b - switch buffer
C-x right arrow - right-cycle through buffer
C-x left arrow - left-cycle through buffer
```

### Close the buffer

```
C-x k
```

### Split the current buffer

```
C-x 2
```

This allows you to see multiple buffers on one screen. To move between these buffers, use: C-x o

### Set a single buffer as the current screen

```
C-x 1
```

If you have ever used a terminal multiplexer like `screen` or `tmux`, the buffer commands will feel very familiar.
