# Emacs

## Lesson Content

Emacs is for users who want an extremely powerful text editor, which may be an understatement because you essentially live in Emacs. You can do all your code editing, file manipulation, etc., all within Emacs. It's a bit slower to load up, and the learning curve is a bit steeper than Vim, but if you want a powerful editor that is extremely extensible, this is the one for you. When I say extensible, I literally mean you can write scripts for Emacs that extend its functionality.

To start Emacs, just use:

```bash
emacs
```

You should be greeted with the default welcome buffer.

Buffers in Emacs are what your text resides in. So, if you open a file, a buffer is used to store that file's content. You can have multiple buffers open at the same time, and you can easily switch between buffers.
