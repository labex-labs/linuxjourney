## Lesson Content

Emacs is for users who want an extremely powerful text editor, which may be an understatement because you essentially live in Emacs. You can do all your code editing, file manipulation, etc., all within Emacs. It's a bit slower to load up, and the learning curve is a bit steeper than Vim, but if you want a powerful editor that is extremely extensible, this is the one for you. When I say extensible, I literally mean you can write scripts for Emacs that extend its functionality.

To start Emacs, just use:

```bash
emacs
```

You should be greeted with the default welcome buffer.

Buffers in Emacs are what your text resides in. So, if you open a file, a buffer is used to store that file's content. You can have multiple buffers open at the same time, and you can easily switch between buffers.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! While there isn't a specific LabEx lab for Emacs, mastering fundamental text editing skills in Linux is crucial for any editor, including Emacs. Here's a hands-on lab to reinforce your understanding of text manipulation in a Linux environment:

1. **[Edit Text Files in Linux with Vim and Nano](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-edit-text-files-in-linux-with-vim-and-nano-591076)** - Practice creating, editing, saving, and navigating text files using two essential Linux text editors, Vim and Nano. This will build a strong foundation for working with any text editor, including Emacs.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of text editing in real scenarios and build confidence with Linux text manipulation.
