# Vim Saving and Exiting

## Lesson Content

Now that you've done your editing, it's time to actually save and quit out of Vim:

- `:w` - writes or saves the file
- `:q` - quits out of Vim
- `:wq` - writes and then quits
- `:q!` - quits out of Vim without saving the file
- `ZZ` - equivalent of `:wq`, but one character faster

- `u` - undo your last action
- `Ctrl-r` - redo your last action

You may not think `ZZ` is necessary, but you'll eventually see that your fingers may tend to lean towards this rather than `:wq`.

Whew, that was a lot of information about Vim. Now that you know some basic commands and navigation, you can start editing some text files. There are many more options you can use in Vim to increase your ability to master this text editor; head on to Vim's online guide to take a look.
