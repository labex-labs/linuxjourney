## Lesson Content

Distance vector protocols determine the path to other networks using the hop count a packet takes across the network. For example, if network A is 3 hops away and network B is next to network A, then we assume network B must be 4 hops away. In distance vector protocols, the next route would be the one with the least number of hops.

Distance vector protocols are great for small networks. However, when networks start to scale, it takes longer for the routers to converge because they periodically send the entire routing table out to every router. Another downside to distance vector protocols is efficiency; they choose routes that are closer in hops, but this may not always be the most efficient route.

One of the common distance vector protocols is RIP (Routing Information Protocol). It broadcasts the routing table to every router in the network every 30 seconds. For a large network, this can consume significant resources. Because of this, RIP limits its hop count to 15.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of network routing and connectivity:

1. **[Explore Network Layer Interaction with ping and arp in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-explore-network-layer-interaction-with-ping-and-arp-in-linux-592746)** - Practice using `ping` and `arp` to understand how devices discover each other and how traffic is routed at the network layer.
2. **[Simulate Network Layer Connectivity in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-simulate-network-layer-connectivity-in-linux-592752)** - Learn to assign IP addresses and test connectivity between simulated Linux nodes, observing how IP subnets influence network communication.
3. **[Manage IP Addressing in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-manage-ip-addressing-in-linux-592736)** - Gain hands-on experience configuring static and dynamic IP addresses and setting default gateways, which are essential components of network routing.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of network addressing and connectivity in real scenarios, building a strong foundation for understanding how routing protocols function.
