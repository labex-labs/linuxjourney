## Lesson Content

It would be a pain to have to manually configure routes on a routing table for every device on your network. Instead, we use what are known as routing protocols. Routing protocols help our system adapt to network changes; they learn different routes, build them into the routing table, and then route our packets that way. There are two primary routing protocol types: distance vector protocols and link state protocols.

### Convergence

Before we talk about the protocols, we should go over a term used in routing known as convergence. When using routing protocols, routers communicate with other routers to collect and exchange information about the network. When they agree on how a network should look, every routing table maps out the complete topology of the network, thus "converging." When something occurs in the network topology, the convergence will temporarily break until all routers are aware of this change.
