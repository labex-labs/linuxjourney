## Lesson Content

Hey rookie! So you decided to dive into this wonderful world known as Linux? Well, you better strap in, because it’s going to be a long and hard road. My name is Penguin Pete, and I’m here to guide you through this journey. Let’s get started with a little bit of backstory about Linux.

To learn about how Linux came to be, let’s go back to the beginning, to 1969, where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.

A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project. The GNU kernel, called Hurd, unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.

The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software. It also does a whole lot of other things, but we’ll dig into that in a different course. For now, just know that the kernel controls pretty much everything that happens on your system.

During this time, other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc., were developed to be UNIX-like systems. However, one thing that all these UNIX-like systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.

Then in 1991, a young fellow named Linus Torvalds started developing what we now know today as the Linux kernel.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Since this lesson introduces you to the world of Linux, getting hands-on with the command line is the best way to solidify your understanding and build confidence. Here are some hands-on labs to help you take your first steps:

1. **[Getting Started with Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-getting-started-with-linux-446315)** - Begin your Linux journey by learning essential terminal commands like `echo`, `date`, and basic calculations. Perfect for complete beginners.
2. **[Your First Linux Lab](https://labex.io/labs/linux-your-first-linux-lab-270253)** - This introductory lab guides you through the classic "Hello, World!" program in Linux and teaches you some fundamental commands.
3. **[Create Personalized Terminal Greeting](https://labex.io/labs/linux-create-personalized-terminal-greeting-446322)** - A quick and fun challenge to use basic Linux terminal commands to create an engaging welcome message.

These labs will help you apply the foundational concepts in a real Linux environment and build confidence with the command line.
