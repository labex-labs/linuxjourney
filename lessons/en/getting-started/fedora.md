## Lesson Content

### Overview

Backed by Red Hat, the Fedora Project is community-driven, containing open-source and free software. Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches off Fedora, so think of Fedora as an upstream RHEL operating system. Eventually, RHEL will get updates from Fedora after thorough testing and quality assurance. Think of Fedora as an Ubuntu equivalent that uses a Red Hat backend instead of Debian.

### Package Management

Uses Red Hat Package Manager.

### Configurability

If you want to use a Red Hat-based operating system, this is a user-friendly version.

### Uses

Fedora is great if you want a Red Hat-based operating system without the price tag. Recommended for desktop and laptop.
