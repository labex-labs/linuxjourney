## Lesson Content

### Overview

Gentoo offers incredible flexibility with the operating system, but it comes at a price. It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind getting their hands dirty with the system.

### Package Management

Gentoo uses its own package management system, Portage. The Portage package management is very modular and easy to maintain, which plays a big part in the operating system as a whole being very flexible.

### Configurability

If you’re just getting started with Linux and want to take a more challenging path, I’d choose Gentoo or Arch Linux as your distribution.

### Uses

Great for desktop and laptop.
