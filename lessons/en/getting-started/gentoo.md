Gentoo offers incredible flexibility with the operating system, but it comes at a price. It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind getting their hands dirty with the system.

Gentoo uses its own package management system, Portage. The Portage package management is very modular and easy to maintain, which plays a big part in the operating system as a whole being very flexible.
