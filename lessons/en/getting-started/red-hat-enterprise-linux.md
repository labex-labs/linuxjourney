## Lesson Content

### Overview

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), commonly referred to as RHEL, is developed by Red Hat. RHEL has strict rules to restrict free redistribution, although it still provides source code for free. It's a commercial Linux distribution designed for enterprise environments with professional support and long-term stability.

### Package Management

RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, the RPM package manager, which we will eventually learn about as well. The RPM system includes YUM and DNF tools for package management and dependency resolution.

### Configurability

RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from Debian-based operating systems, most noticeably in package management. If you decide to go with RHEL, it's probably best if you know you'll be working with it.

### Uses

As described by the name, it's mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a solid server OS, this would be a good one. RHEL is particularly popular for mission-critical applications, web servers, and database systems in corporate environments.

### Certification Path

RHEL administrators can pursue Red Hat certifications including RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) and RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer), which are highly valued in the industry.
