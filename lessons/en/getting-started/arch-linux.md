## Lesson Content

### Overview

Arch is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution driven 100% by the community. Similar to Debian, Arch uses a rolling release model, so incremental updates eventually become the stable release. You really need to get your hands dirty to understand the system and its functions, but in turn, you get complete and total control of your system.

### Package Management

It uses its own package manager, Pacman, to install, update, and manage packages.

### Configurability

If you want a lightweight operating system and truly want to understand Linux, use Arch! There's a bit of a learning curve, but for hardcore Linux users, this is a great choice.

### Uses

Great for desktop and laptop. If you also have a small device such as a Raspberry Pi and need to install a lightweight OS on it, you can't go wrong with Arch.
