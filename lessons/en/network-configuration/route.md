## Lesson Content

We've already discussed viewing our routing tables with the `route` command. If you want to add or remove routes, you can do so manually.

### Add a new route

```bash
sudo route add -net 192.168.2.1/23 gw 10.11.12.3
```

### Delete a route

```bash
sudo route del -net 192.168.2.1/23
```

You can also perform these changes with the **ip** command:

### To add a route

```bash
ip route add 192.168.2.1/23 via 10.11.12.3
```

### To delete a route

```bash
$ ip route delete 192.168.2.1/23 via 10.11.12.3
or
$ ip route delete 192.168.2.1/23
```

## Exercise
