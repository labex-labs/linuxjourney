## Lesson Content

Of course, if you want your system's networking up and running automatically, there is something already in place for that. Most distributions utilize the NetworkManager daemon to configure their networks automatically.

You'll notice NetworkManager in the form of an applet somewhere on your desktop taskbar if you are using a GUI. As you can see, it manages your network's hardware and connection information. For instance, on startup, NetworkManager will gather network hardware information, search for connections (wireless, wired, etc.), and then activate them.

There are also command-line tools to interact with NetworkManager:

### nm-tool

`nm-tool` reports NetworkManager's state and its devices.
