## Lesson Content

Let's say I wanted to send an email to Patty. We'll go through each of the TCP/IP layers to see this in action.

Remember that packets are used to transmit data across networks. A packet consists of a header and a payload. The header contains information about where the packet is going and where it came from. The payload is the actual data that is being transferred. As our packet traverses the network, each layer adds a bit of information to the header of the packet. Also, keep in mind that different layers use a different term for our "packet." In the transport layer, we essentially encapsulate our data in a segment, and in the link layer, we refer to this as a frame, but just know that "packet" can be used in regards to the same thing.

First, we start off in the application layer. When we send our email through our email client, the application layer will encapsulate this data. The application layer talks to the transport layer through a specified port, and through this port, it sends its data. We want to send an email through the application layer protocol SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The data is sent through our transport protocol, which opens a connection to this port (port 25 is used for SMTP). So, we get this data sent through this port, and that data is sent to the Transport layer to be encapsulated into segments.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here is a hands-on lab to reinforce your understanding of network layers and ports:

1. **[Analyze Network Ports and Sessions with netstat in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-analyze-network-ports-and-sessions-with-netstat-in-linux-592741)** - In this lab, you will learn how to use the `netstat` command to analyze network activity, exploring fundamental concepts such as network ports, sockets, and active connections. This will give you practical insight into how services communicate over the network, directly relating to the transport layer concepts discussed.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of network communication and port usage in a real Linux environment, building your confidence in understanding how applications interact with the network stack.
