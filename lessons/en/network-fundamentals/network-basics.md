## Lesson Content

Let's look at a typical home network; you have a few different components.

- ISP - Your internet service provider, the company you pay to get internet at your house.
- Router - The router allows each machine on your network to connect to the internet. In most modern routers, you can connect via wireless or an Ethernet cable.
- WAN - Wide Area Network. This is what we call the network that encompasses everything between your router and a wider network, such as the internet.
- WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network. This is the network between your router and any wireless devices you may have, such as laptops.
- LAN - Local Area Network. This is the network between your router and any wired devices, such as desktop PCs.
- Hosts - Each machine on a network is known as a host.

The data and information that gets transmitted through networks are known as packets, and by the end of the Networking Nomad section, you'll understand in detail how a packet travels to and from hosts.
