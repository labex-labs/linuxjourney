## Lesson Content

Let's look at a typical home network; you have a few different components.

- ISP - Your internet service provider, the company you pay to get internet at your house.
- Router - The router allows each machine on your network to connect to the internet. In most modern routers, you can connect via wireless or an Ethernet cable.
- WAN - Wide Area Network. This is what we call the network that encompasses everything between your router and a wider network, such as the internet.
- WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network. This is the network between your router and any wireless devices you may have, such as laptops.
- LAN - Local Area Network. This is the network between your router and any wired devices, such as desktop PCs.
- Hosts - Each machine on a network is known as a host.

The data and information that gets transmitted through networks are known as packets, and by the end of the Networking Nomad section, you'll understand in detail how a packet travels to and from hosts.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Hands-on experience is crucial for understanding networking fundamentals. Here are some labs to reinforce your understanding of network components and how hosts communicate:

1. **[Identify MAC and IP Addresses in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-identify-mac-and-ip-addresses-in-linux-592731)** - Practice identifying network addressing information for hosts, including MAC and IP addresses, using the `ip a` command.
2. **[Explore IP Address Types and Reachability in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-explore-ip-address-types-and-reachability-in-linux-592780)** - Learn to test network reachability and identify different IP address types, essential for understanding how hosts connect.
3. **[Explore Network Layer Interaction with ping and arp in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-explore-network-layer-interaction-with-ping-and-arp-in-linux-592746)** - Understand how hosts interact on a network by observing the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and testing connectivity with `ping`.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of hosts, addressing, and basic connectivity in real scenarios and build confidence with fundamental networking.
