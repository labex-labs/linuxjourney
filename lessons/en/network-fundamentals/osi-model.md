## Lesson Content

Before we can look at some practical networking concepts, we have to go over some jargon that you've probably heard of before. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a theoretical model of networking. This model shows us how a packet traverses through a network in seven different layers. I won't get into the specifics of this model, since most networking courses will be focused on the TCP/IP model, but it should be mentioned that such a theoretical networking model exists and has actually played a large part in the TCP/IP networking model that we use today.

## Exercise

While the OSI model is theoretical, understanding its influence on practical networking is key. Hands-on practice with fundamental networking commands will help solidify your understanding of how these theoretical models translate into real-world network operations.

Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of basic networking concepts:

1. **[Identify MAC and IP Addresses in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-identify-mac-and-ip-addresses-in-linux-592731)** - Practice using the `ip a` command to identify network addressing information, including MAC and IP addresses, on a Linux system.
2. **[Manage IP Addressing in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-manage-ip-addressing-in-linux-592736)** - Learn to configure static and dynamic IP addresses, set a default gateway, and verify network configurations using the `ip` command.
3. **[Explore Network Layer Interaction with ping and arp in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-explore-network-layer-interaction-with-ping-and-arp-in-linux-592746)** - Use `ping` and `arp` commands to explore how the network and data link layers interact, observing ARP in action and understanding default gateway behavior.

These labs will help you apply foundational networking concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with Linux network administration.
