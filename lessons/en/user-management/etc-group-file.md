## Lesson Content

Another file used in user management is the `/etc/group` file. This file allows for different groups with different permissions.

```bash
$ cat /etc/group

root:*:0:pete
```

Very similar to the `/etc/passwd` file, the `/etc/group` fields are as follows:

1. Group name
2. Group password - there isn't a need to set a group password; using an elevated privilege like `sudo` is standard. An asterisk (`*`) will be put in place as the default value.
3. Group ID (GID)
4. List of users - you can manually specify users you want in a specific group

## Exercise
