## Lesson Content

The `paste` command is similar to the `cat` command; it merges lines together in a file. Let's create a new file with the following contents:

```
sample2.txt
The
quick
brown
fox
```

Let's combine all these lines into one line:

```bash
paste -s sample2.txt
```

The default delimiter for `paste` is TAB, so now there is one line with TABs separating each word.

Let's change this delimiter (`-d`) to something a little more readable:

```bash
paste -d ' ' -s sample2.txt
```

Now everything should be on one line delimited by spaces.
