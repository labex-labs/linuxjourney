## Lesson Content

The `grep` command is quite possibly the most common text processing command you will use. It allows you to search files for characters that match a certain pattern. What if you wanted to know if a file existed in a certain directory, or if you wanted to see if a string was found in a file? You certainly wouldn't dig through every line of text; you would use `grep`!

Let's use our `sample.txt` file as an example:

```bash
grep fox sample.txt
```

You should see that `grep` found "fox" in the `sample.txt` file.

You can also `grep` patterns that are case-insensitive with the `-i` flag:

```bash
grep -i somepattern somefile
```

To get even more flexible with `grep`, you can combine it with other commands using `|`.

```bash
env | grep -i User
```

As you can see, `grep` is pretty versatile. You can even use regular expressions in your pattern:

```bash
ls /somedir | grep '.txt$'
```

This should return all files ending with `.txt` in `somedir`.

## Exercise

You may have heard of `egrep` or `fgrep`; these are deprecated `grep` calls and have since been replaced by `grep -E` and `grep -F`. Read the `grep` manpage to learn more.
