## Lesson Content

The `sort` command is useful for sorting lines.

```plaintext
file1.txt
dog
cow
cat
elephant
bird

$ sort file1.txt
bird
cat
cow
dog
elephant
```

You can also do a reverse sort:

```bash
$ sort -r file1.txt
elephant
dog
cow
cat
bird
```

And also sort by numerical value:

```bash
$ sort -n file1.txt
bird
cat
cow
elephant
dog
```

## Exercise

```bash
ls /etc | sort -rn
```
