## Lesson Content

The `tr` (translate) command allows you to translate one set of characters into another set of characters. Let's try an example of translating all lowercase characters to uppercase characters.

```bash
$ tr a-z A-Z
hello
HELLO
```

As you can see, we made the ranges of `a-z` into `A-Z`, and all text we type that is lowercase gets uppercased.

## Exercise

Try the following command. What happens?

```bash
$ tr -d ello
hello
```
