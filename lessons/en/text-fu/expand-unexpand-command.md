## Lesson Content

In our lesson on the `cut` command, we had our `sample.txt` file that contained a tab. Normally, tabs would usually show a noticeable difference, but some text files don't show that well enough. Having tabs in a text file may not provide the desired spacing. To change your tabs to spaces, use the `expand` command.

```bash
expand sample.txt
```

The command above will print output with each tab converted into a group of spaces. To save this output in a file, use output redirection as shown below.

```bash
expand sample.txt > result.txt
```

Opposite to `expand`, we can convert back each group of spaces to a tab with the `unexpand` command:

```bash
unexpand -a result.txt
```
