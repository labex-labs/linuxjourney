## Lesson Content

The `wc` (word count) command shows the total count of words in a file.

```bash
$ wc /etc/passwd
 96     265    5925 /etc/passwd
```

It displays the number of lines, number of words, and number of bytes, respectively.

To see just the count of a certain field, use the `-l`, `-w`, or `-c` options, respectively.

```bash
$ wc -l /etc/passwd
96
```

Another command you can use to check the count of lines in a file is the `nl` (number lines) command.

```plaintext
file1.txt
i
like
turtles
```

```bash
$ nl file1.txt
1. i
2. like
3. turtles
```

## Exercise
