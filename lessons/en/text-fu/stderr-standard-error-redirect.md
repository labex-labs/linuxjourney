## Lesson Content

Let's try something a little different now. Let's try to list the contents of a directory that doesn't exist on your system and redirect the output to the `peanuts.txt` file again.

```bash
ls /fake/directory > peanuts.txt
```

What you should see is:

```plaintext
ls: cannot access /fake/directory: No such file or directory
```

Now you're probably thinking, shouldn't that message have been sent to the file? There is actually another I/O stream in play here called standard error (stderr). By default, stderr sends its output to the screen as well; it's a completely different stream than stdout. So you'll need to redirect its output a different way.

Unfortunately, the redirector is not as nice as using `<` or `>` but it's pretty close. We will have to use file descriptors. A file descriptor is a non-negative number that is used to access a file or stream. We will go in depth about this later, but for now know that the file descriptor for stdin, stdout, and stderr is 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

So now if we want to redirect our stderr to the file we can do this:

```bash
ls /fake/directory 2> peanuts.txt
```

You should see just the stderr messages in `peanuts.txt`.

Now what if I wanted to see both stderr and stdout in the `peanuts.txt` file? It's possible to do this with file descriptors as well:

```bash
ls /fake/directory > peanuts.txt 2>&1
```

This sends the results of `ls /fake/directory` to the `peanuts.txt` file and then it redirects stderr to stdout via `2>&1`. The order of operations here matters; `2>&1` sends stderr to whatever stdout is pointing to. In this case, stdout is pointing to a file, so `2>&1` also sends stderr to a file. So if you open up that `peanuts.txt` file you should see both stderr and stdout. In our case, the above command only outputs stderr.

There is a shorter way to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file:

```bash
ls /fake/directory &> peanuts.txt
```

Now what if I don't want any of that cruft and want to get rid of stderr messages completely? Well, you can also redirect output to a special file called `/dev/null` and it will discard any input.

```bash
ls /fake/directory 2> /dev/null
```

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of input/output redirection:

1. **[Redirecting Input and Output in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-redirecting-input-and-output-in-linux-590840)** - In this lab, you will learn to redirect input and output in the Linux shell. You will practice controlling data flow from commands by manipulating standard output (stdout), standard error (stderr), and standard input (stdin) using operators like >, >>, 2>, and the tee command.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of I/O redirection in real scenarios and build confidence with managing data streams in Linux.
