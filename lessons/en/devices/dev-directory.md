## Lesson Content

When you connect a device to your machine, it generally needs a device driver to function properly. You can interact with device drivers through device files or device nodes; these are special files that look like regular files. Since these device files are just like regular files, you can use programs such as `ls`, `cat`, etc., to interact with them. These device files are generally stored in the `/dev` directory. Go ahead and `ls` the `/dev` directory on your system; you'll see a large amount of device files that are on your system.

```bash
ls /dev
```

Some of these devices you've already used and interacted with, such as `/dev/null`. Remember when we send output to `/dev/null`, the kernel knows that this device takes all of our input and just discards it, so nothing gets returned.

In the old days, if you wanted to add a device to your system, you'd add the device file in `/dev` and then probably forget about it. Well, repeat that a couple of times, and you can see where there was a problem. The `/dev` directory would get cluttered with static device files of devices that you've long since upgraded, stopped using, etc. Devices are also assigned device files in the order that the kernel finds them. So, if every time you rebooted your system, the devices could have different device files depending on when they were discovered.

Thankfully, we no longer use that method. Now we have something that we use to dynamically add and remove devices that are currently being used on the system, and we'll be discussing this in the coming lessons.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of hardware devices and their interaction with the Linux system:

1. **[Explore Hardware Devices in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-explore-hardware-devices-in-linux-590861)** - In this lab, you will learn the essential skills to explore, identify, and inspect hardware devices within a Linux environment. You will gain hands-on experience with powerful command-line utilities to understand how the operating system interacts with physical components.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of device interaction in real scenarios and build confidence with managing hardware in Linux.
