## Lesson Content

Ah, the Batmans of package management! These systems come with all the fixings to make package installation, removal, and changes easier, including installing package dependencies. Two of the most popular management systems are **yum** and **apt**. Yum is exclusive to the Red Hat family, and apt is exclusive to the Debian family.

### Install a package from a repository

```bash
Debian: $ apt install package_name
RPM: $ yum install package_name
```

### Remove a package

```bash
Debian: $ apt remove package_name
RPM: $ yum erase package_name
```

### Updating packages for a repository

It's always best practice to update your package repositories so they are up to date before you install and update a package.

```bash
Debian: apt update; apt upgrade
RPM: yum update
```

### Get information about an installed package

```bash
Debian: apt show package_name
RPM: yum info package_name
```
