## Lesson Content

Your system is comprised of many packages such as internet browsers, text editors, media players, etc. These packages are managed via package managers, which install and maintain the software on your system. Not all packages are installed through package managers though; you can commonly install packages directly from their source code (we'll get to that soon). However, the majority of the time you will use a package manager to install software. The most common varieties of packages are Debian (.deb) and Red Hat (.rpm). Debian-style packages are used in distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc. Red Hat-style packages are seen in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, etc.

What are packages? You may know them as Chrome, Photoshop, etc., and they are, but what they really are is just lots and lots of files that have been compiled into one. The people (or sometimes a single person) that write this software are known as **upstream providers**; they compile their code and write up how to get it installed. These upstream providers work on getting out new software and updating existing software. When they are ready to release it to the world, they send their package to **package maintainers**, who handle getting this piece of software into the hands of the users. These package maintainers review, manage, and distribute this software in the form of packages.
