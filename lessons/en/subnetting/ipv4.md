## Lesson Content

So we know that network hosts have a unique address they can be found at. These addresses are known as IP addresses. An IPv4 address looks something like this:

```
204.23.124.23
```

This address actually contains two parts: the network portion that tells us which network it's on, and the host portion that tells us which host on that network it is. For this course, we will mostly be discussing IPv4 addresses, which are what you commonly will see when referring to IP addresses.

An IP address is separated into octets by periods. So there are 4 octets in an IPv4 address. If you know a bit of computer science, an octet is 8 bits, and 8 bits actually equal 1 byte, so we also refer to an IPv4 address as having 4 bytes. We use bits frequently when dealing with subnets and IP addresses.

You can view your IP address with the `ifconfig -a` command:

```bash
pete@icebox:~$ ifconfig -a
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 1d:3a:32:24:4d:ce
          inet addr:192.168.1.129  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fd60::21c:29ff:fe63:5cdc/64 Scope:Link
```

As you can see, my IPv4 address is: 192.168.1.129

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of IP addressing and network identification in Linux:

1. **[Identify MAC and IP Addresses in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-identify-mac-and-ip-addresses-in-linux-592731)** - Practice using the `ip a` command to identify network addressing information, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, on a Linux system.
2. **[Explore IP Address Types and Reachability in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-explore-ip-address-types-and-reachability-in-linux-592780)** - Explore different IP address types and test network reachability using commands like `ping` and `ip a`.
3. **[Perform IP Subnetting and Binary Conversion in the Linux Terminal](https://labex.io/labs/linux-perform-ip-subnetting-and-binary-conversion-in-the-linux-terminal-592782)** - Master IP subnetting and binary conversion, essential for a deeper understanding of how IP addresses and networks are structured at the bit level.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of IP addressing in real scenarios and build confidence with network configuration and troubleshooting in Linux.
