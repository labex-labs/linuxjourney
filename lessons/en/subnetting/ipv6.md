# IPv6

## Lesson Content

We've heard the term IPv6 here and there, but what is it? Every device that connects to the Internet gets its own IP address. Well, that happens to be a finite number that we are soon approaching in this digital age. IPv6 was created to allow us to connect more hosts to the Internet; it comes with more IP improvements. However, its adoption is quite slow. It isn't meant to replace IPv4; they are meant to complement each other. The two IP protocols are very similar, and if you know IPv4, you'll understand IPv6. The major difference is the way the address is written. Here is what a typical IPv6 address looks like:

```plaintext
2dde:1235:1256:3:200:f8ed:fe23:59cf
```
