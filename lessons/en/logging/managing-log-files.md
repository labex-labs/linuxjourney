## Lesson Content

Log files generate a lot of data and store this data on your hard disks. However, there are many issues with this. For the most part, we just want to be able to see newer logs. We also want to manage our disk space efficiently. So, how do we do all of this? The answer is with `logrotate`.

The `logrotate` utility performs log management for us. It has a configuration file that allows us to specify how many and which logs to keep, how to compress our logs to save space, and more. The `logrotate` tool is usually run out of cron once a day, and the configuration files can be found in `/etc/logrotate.d`.

There are other log rotation tools you can use to manage your logs, but `logrotate` is the most common one.

## Exercise

Look at your `logrotate` configuration file and see how it manages some of your logs.
