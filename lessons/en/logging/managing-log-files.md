## Lesson Content

Log files generate a lot of data and store this data on your hard disks. However, there are many issues with this. For the most part, we just want to be able to see newer logs. We also want to manage our disk space efficiently. So, how do we do all of this? The answer is with `logrotate`.

The `logrotate` utility performs log management for us. It has a configuration file that allows us to specify how many and which logs to keep, how to compress our logs to save space, and more. The `logrotate` tool is usually run out of cron once a day, and the configuration files can be found in `/etc/logrotate.d`.

There are other log rotation tools you can use to manage your logs, but `logrotate` is the most common one.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of log file management and related system administration tasks:

1. **[Viewing Log and Configuration Files in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-viewing-log-and-configuration-files-in-linux-387914)** - Practice essential Linux command-line skills for efficiently viewing and navigating text files, including system logs and configuration files, which are managed by tools like `logrotate`.
2. **[Rapid Threat Detection](https://labex.io/labs/linux-rapid-threat-detection-387930)** - Learn essential Linux command-line skills for cybersecurity analysis. Use `tail` and `head` commands to quickly extract and analyze recent log entries, simulating rapid threat detection in a high-stakes tech environment.
3. **[Create and Restore a Backup with tar in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-create-and-restore-a-backup-with-tar-in-linux-590843)** - Gain hands-on experience with system administration tasks by backing up directories, which is often a part of log rotation strategies to archive old logs.

These labs will help you apply the concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with managing and interacting with log files in Linux.
