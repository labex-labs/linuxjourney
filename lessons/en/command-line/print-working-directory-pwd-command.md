## Lesson Content

Everything in Linux is a file. As you journey deeper into Linux, you'll understand this, but for now, just keep that in mind. Every file is organized in a hierarchical directory tree. The first directory in the filesystem is aptly named the root directory. The root directory has many folders and files, which can store more folders and files, etc. Here is an example of what the directory tree looks like:

```plaintext
/
|-- bin
|   |-- file1
|   |-- file2
|-- etc
|   |-- file3
|   `-- directory1
|       |-- file4
|       `-- file5
|-- home
|-- var
```

The location of these files and directories are referred to as paths. If you had a folder named `home` with a folder inside of it named `pete` and another folder in that folder called `Movies`, that path would look like this: `/home/pete/Movies`. Pretty simple, huh?

Navigation of the filesystem, much like real life, is helpful if you know where you are and where you are going. To see where you are, you can use the `pwd` command. This command means "print working directory" and it just shows you which directory you are in. Note that the path stems from the root directory.

```bash
pwd
```

Where are you? Where am I? Give it a try.
