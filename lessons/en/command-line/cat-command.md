## Lesson Content

We’re almost done navigating files, but first, let’s learn how to read a file. A simple command to use is the `cat` command, short for concatenate. It not only displays file contents but it can combine multiple files and show you their output.

```bash
cat dogfile birdfile
```

It’s not great for viewing large files and it’s only meant for short content. There are many other tools that we use to view larger text files that we’ll discuss in the next lesson.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of viewing file contents:

1. **[Linux cat Command: File Concatenating](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-cat-command-file-concatenating-210986)** - Learn the `cat` command for viewing, concatenating, and manipulating text files, enhancing your command-line skills for efficient text file handling.
2. **[Viewing Log and Configuration Files in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-viewing-log-and-configuration-files-in-linux-387914)** - Practice using commands like `cat` to efficiently view and navigate text files, including system logs and configuration files, to extract critical information.

These labs will help you apply the concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with file content viewing in Linux.
