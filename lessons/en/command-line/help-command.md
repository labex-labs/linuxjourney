## Lesson Content

Linux has some great built-in tools to help you understand how to use a command or check what flags are available for a command. One tool, `help`, is a built-in Bash command that provides help for other Bash commands (e.g., `echo`, `logout`, `pwd`).

```bash
help echo
```

This will give you a description and the options you can use when you want to run `echo`. For other executable programs, it’s convention to have an option called `--help` or something similar.

```bash
echo --help
```

Not all developers who ship executables will conform to this standard, but it’s probably your best shot to find some help on a program.
