## Lesson Content

Well, you sure did a good job getting through the basics. We've only scratched the surface; now that you've learned to crawl, in the next set of courses, I'm going to teach you how to walk.

For now, you can pat yourself on the back and take a break. To exit from the shell, you can use the `exit` command:

```bash
exit
```

Or the `logout` command:

```bash
logout
```

Or if you are working out of a terminal GUI, you can just close the terminal. See you in the next course!
