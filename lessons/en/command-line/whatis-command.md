## Lesson Content

Whew, we’ve learned quite a bit of commands so far! If you are ever feeling doubtful about what a command does, you can use the `whatis` command. The `whatis` command provides a brief description of command-line programs.

```bash
whatis cat
```

The description gets sourced from the manual page of each command. If you ran `whatis cat`, you’d see a small blurb with a short description.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! While there isn't a specific lab for the `whatis` command, understanding how to find information about commands and files is crucial. Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of locating commands and files in Linux:

1. **[Linux which Command: Command Locating](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-which-command-command-locating-215210)** - Practice using the `which` command to locate executable files and understand command priority in your system's PATH.
2. **[Linux whereis Command: File and Command Finding](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-whereis-command-file-and-command-finding-215211)** - Learn to use `whereis` to find the binary, source, and manual pages for commands, deepening your understanding of how commands are structured.
3. **[Discover Critical System Resources](https://labex.io/labs/linux-discover-critical-system-resources-388032)** - This challenge combines `which`, `whereis`, and `find` to help you efficiently navigate the file system and discover important system resources.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of command and file discovery in real scenarios and build confidence with essential Linux utilities.
