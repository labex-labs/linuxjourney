## Lesson Content

Gee, I wish some of these programs had a manual so we could see more information about them. Well, luckily they do! Aptly named man pages, you can see the manuals for a command with the `man` command.

```bash
man ls
```

Man pages are manuals that are, by default, built into most Linux operating systems. They provide documentation about commands and other aspects of the system.

Try it out on a few commands to get more information about them.
