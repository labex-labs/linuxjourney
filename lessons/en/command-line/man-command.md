## Lesson Content

Gee, I wish some of these programs had a manual so we could see more information about them. Well, luckily they do! Aptly named man pages, you can see the manuals for a command with the `man` command.

```bash
man ls
```

Man pages are manuals that are, by default, built into most Linux operating systems. They provide documentation about commands and other aspects of the system.

Try it out on a few commands to get more information about them.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of fundamental Linux commands, which you can then explore further using `man` pages:

1. **[Linux ls Command: Content Listing](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-ls-command-content-listing-219205)** - Practice listing and analyzing file and directory contents, and then use `man ls` to discover more options.
2. **[Linux pwd Command: Directory Displaying](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-pwd-command-directory-displaying-209734)** - Learn the `pwd` command to display your current directory, and explore its man page for details.
3. **[Linux cd Command: Directory Changing](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-cd-command-directory-changing-209733)** - Master navigating your file system with `cd`, and use `man cd` to understand its various techniques.

These labs will help you apply core concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with essential Linux commands, preparing you to effectively use `man` to deepen your knowledge.
