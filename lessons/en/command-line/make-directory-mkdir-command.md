## Lesson Content

We're going to need some directories to store all these files we've been working on. The `mkdir` command (Make Directory) is useful for that; it will create a directory if it doesn't already exist. You can even make multiple directories at the same time.

```bash
mkdir books paintings
```

You can also create subdirectories at the same time with the `-p` (parent flag).

```bash
mkdir -p books/hemmingway/favorites
```
