## Lesson Content

Sometimes typing commands can get really repetitive, or if you need to type a long command many times, it's best to have an alias you can use for that. To create an alias for a command, you simply specify an alias name and set it to the command.

```bash
alias foobar='ls -la'
```

Now, instead of typing `ls -la`, you can type `foobar`, and it will execute that commandâ€”pretty neat stuff. Keep in mind that this command won't save your alias after reboot, so you'll need to add a permanent alias in:

```plaintext
~/.bashrc
```

or similar files if you want to have it persist after reboot.

You can remove aliases with the `unalias` command:

```bash
unalias foobar
```
