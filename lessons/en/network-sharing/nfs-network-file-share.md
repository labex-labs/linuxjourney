## Lesson Content

The most standard network file share for Linux is NFS (Network File System). NFS allows a server to share directories and files with one or more clients over the network.

We won't get into the details of how to create an NFS server, as it can get complex; however, we will discuss setting up NFS clients.

### Setting up NFS client

```bash
sudo service nfsclient start
sudo mount server:/directory /mount_directory
```

### Automounting

Let's say you use the NFS server quite often and you want to keep it permanently mounted. Normally, you might think you'd edit the `/etc/fstab` file, but you may not always get a connection to the server, and that can cause issues on bootup. Instead, what you want to do is set up automounting so that you can connect to the NFS server when you need to. This is done with the **automount** tool or, in recent versions of Linux, **amd**. When a file is accessed in a specified directory, automount will look up the remote server and automatically mount it.
