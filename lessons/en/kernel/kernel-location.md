## Lesson Content

What happens when you install a new kernel? Well, it actually adds a couple of files to your system; these files are usually added to the `/boot` directory.

You will see multiple files for different kernel versions:

- `vmlinuz` - this is the actual Linux kernel
- `initrd` - as we've discussed before, the `initrd` is used as a temporary file system, used before loading the kernel
- `System.map` - symbolic lookup table
- `config` - kernel configuration settings; if you are compiling your own kernel, you can set which modules can be loaded

If your `/boot` directory runs out of space, you can always delete old versions of these files or just use a package manager. But be careful when doing maintenance in this directory, and don't accidentally delete the kernel you are currently using.

## Exercise

Go into your boot directory and see what files are in there.
