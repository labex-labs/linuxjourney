### Lesson Template

Each lesson file must follow this exact structure with **4 fixed sections**:

```markdown
---
lang: "en"
title: "Lesson Title"
description: "Brief lesson description for SEO (under 160 characters)"
keywords: "relevant, keywords, for, search, engines"
---

## Lesson Content

Write your main teaching content here using **level 3 headers (###)** to structure content:

### Introduction
Brief overview of the topic.

### Basic Concepts
Explain fundamental concepts clearly.

### Practical Examples
Use code blocks for commands:
```bash
$ command --example
```

### Advanced Usage

Cover more complex scenarios if needed.

Keep content:

- Clear and concise
- Beginner-friendly
- Practical with real examples
- Well-structured with level 3 headers only

## Exercise

Provide hands-on practice:

- Give specific tasks to complete
- Include expected outputs
- Mention common pitfalls
- Link to additional resources if needed

## Quiz Question

Ask a question to test understanding:

- Make it specific and clear
- Avoid trick questions
- Focus on practical knowledge

## Quiz Answer

Provide the correct answer with brief explanation if needed.

```

### Template Rules

- **Fixed sections**: The 4 main sections (## headers) cannot be modified or renamed
- **No new sections**: Cannot add additional level 2 headers (##)
- **Level 3 headers only**: Use ### headers within "Lesson Content" to structure content
- **Consistent structure**: All lessons must follow this exact format

### File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `process-management.md`
- Be descriptive: `network-interface-configuration.md`
- Keep names concise but clear

## Translation Guidelines

### Translation Process

**LabEx Team Handles Initial Translation**
- New English lessons are automatically translated using latest AI
- AI generates consistent, high-quality translations across all supported languages
- Translations maintain technical accuracy and formatting

### Native Speaker Contributions

**Review and Improve Existing Translations**
- Check AI-generated translations for accuracy
- Improve natural language flow
- Fix cultural references and idioms
- Ensure technical terms are correctly translated

**What Native Speakers Can Do:**
- Review lessons in `lessons/{language_code}/`
- Submit corrections for grammar and clarity
- Improve technical terminology
- Update language-specific examples when appropriate

**What to Avoid:**
- Starting new translations from scratch
- Large-scale manual translation projects
- Inconsistent terminology across lessons

### Language Configuration

When reviewing translations, you may need to update `i18n/{language_code}.yml`:

```yaml
{language_code}:
  menu:
    languages:
      lang: "üè¥ Language Name"
  home:
    tagline:
      title: "Translated tagline"
    # ... other translations
```

### Translation Standards

- Maintain the same structure as English lessons
- Preserve all frontmatter fields
- Keep code examples in English (commands are universal)
- Ensure consistency with existing translations
- Follow language-specific style guides

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/lesson-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes locally
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Push and create a pull request

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues when applicable
- Keep commits focused on single changes

Examples:

```
Add new lesson: Process monitoring with top
Fix typo in filesystem lesson
Update German translation for network module
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **File Limit**: Each PR should modify no more than 3 files to keep reviews manageable
2. Ensure your changes follow the lesson template
3. Check for spelling and grammar errors
4. Test any code examples you include
5. Update related documentation if needed
6. Write a clear PR description explaining changes

### PR Guidelines

- **Small, focused changes**: Keep PRs small and focused on a single topic
- **File limit**: Maximum 3 files per PR (exceptions may be made for translation reviews)
- **Single purpose**: One lesson addition, one bug fix, or one feature at a time
- **Large changes**: Split big updates into multiple smaller PRs
- **New lessons**: Must be in English only - translations handled by LabEx team
- **Translation PRs**: Focus on reviewing and improving existing AI translations

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Use clear, simple language
- Explain technical terms when first introduced
- Include practical examples
- **Structure content with level 3 headers (###) only within Lesson Content**
- **Never modify the 4 fixed section headers (##)**
- Use bullet points for lists

### Code Examples

- Use realistic, working examples
- Include command prompts (`$` for user, `#` for root)
- Show expected output when helpful
- Explain what each command does

### Best Practices

- Start with basics before advanced concepts
- Build upon previous lessons
- Include troubleshooting tips
- Reference related lessons when appropriate
- Keep lessons focused on single topics
